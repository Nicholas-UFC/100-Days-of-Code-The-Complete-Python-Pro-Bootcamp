#You are going to write a program that will mark a spot on a map with an X.

#In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.

#This map contains a nested list. When map is printed this is what it looks like, notice the nesting:

#[['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']]

#This is a bit hard to work with. So on lines 6 and 23, we've used this line of code print(f"{line1}\n{line2}\n{line3}") to format the 3 lists to be printed as a 3 by 3 grid, each on a new line.

#['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

#['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

#['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
#Now it looks a bit more like the coordinates of a real map:

line1 = ["⬜️","️⬜️","️⬜️"]
line2 = ["⬜️","⬜️","️⬜️"]
line3 = ["⬜️️","⬜️️","⬜️️"]
map = [line1, line2, line3]
print("Hiding your treasure! X marks the spot.")
position = str(input()) # Where do you want to put the treasure?
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆
# Write your code below this row 👇
letra = position[0].lower()
abc = ['a','b','c']
letra_index = abc.index(letra)
numero_index = int(position[1])-1
map[numero_index][letra_index] = 'X'
# Write your code above this row 👆
# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
print(f"{line1}\n{line2}\n{line3}")
