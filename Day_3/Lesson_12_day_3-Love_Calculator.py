#You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.

#To work out the love score between two people:

#Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.

#Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.

#Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

#For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:

#"Your score is *x*, you go together like coke and mentos."
#For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:

#"Your score is *y*, you are alright together."
#Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:

#"Your score is *z*."
#e.g.

#name1 = "Angela Yu"
#name2 = "Jack Bauer"
#T occurs 0 times

#R occurs 1 time

#U occurs 2 times

#E occurs 2 times

#Total = 5

#L occurs 1 time

#O occurs 0 times

#V occurs 0 times

#E occurs 2 times

#Total = 3

#Love Score = 53

#Print: "Your score is 53."

print("The Love Calculator is calculating your score...")
